Hatchet is a Python-based library that allows [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) dataframes to be indexed by structured tree and graph data. It is intended for analyzing performance data that has a hierarchy (for example, serial or parallel profiles that represent calling context trees, call graphs, nested regions’ timers, etc.). Hatchet implements various operations to analyze a single hierarchical data set or compare multiple data sets, and its API facilitates analyzing such data programmatically.

To use hatchet, install it with pip:

```
$ pip install hatchet
```

Or, if you want to develop with this repo directly, run the install script from
the root directory, which will build the cython modules and add the cloned
directory to your `PYTHONPATH`:

```
$ source install.sh
```
