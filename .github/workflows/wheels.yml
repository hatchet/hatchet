# Github Actions Workflow for building wheels

# The step for creating a github release is borrowed from cython
# https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/.github/workflows/wheels.yml

# The general structure of the workflow is also highly inspired by pandas'
# wheel builder workflow
# https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/.github/workflows/wheels.yml

# Inspiration for doing this also came from the LLNL hatchet wheel building workflow
# https://github.com/LLNL/hatchet/blob/develop/.github/workflows/build_and_upload_wheels.yaml
